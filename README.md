# BURGER DOOM

A backport & remaster of 3DO DOOM for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## About This Project

BURGER DOOM is a project derived from the [3DO DOOM source code release by Rebecca Ann Heineman](https://github.com/Olde-Skuul/doom3do) and the Phoenix Doom project. The aim of this project is to allow the original 3DO version of DOOM to be played on modern operating systems.

Goals of BURGER DOOM

1. Restore IWAD and PWAD loading in order to play the PC IWAD's and community vanilla PWADS
2. Keep the current AIFF audio (we want only live band music please, no MIDI nonsense)
3. Increase the engine limits while keeping many 3DO-specific bugs intact
4. QoL enhancements that will be kept from Phoenix Doom (such as the punch sound being added back)..  it is just annoying when there is no sound
5. Scaling to monitor resolution but without any further configurations (only the 3:2 aspect ratio is supported and everything else removed)
